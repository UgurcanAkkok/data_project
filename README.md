# Data Project
Bahcesehir University, Data Structures and Algorithms course term project.

 
You are expected to write a c++ console application which reads a csv file that consists of transactions 
occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.

 
Your program must be able to store individual products (given with StockCode) from csv file and insert it 
into a suitable data structure. If that product is already inserted into the structure, its counter must be 
increased by the quantity of the order.  
 
After reading and processing is over, your program must list the “top 10” products ordered by individuals.
